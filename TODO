parallelize using Parallel::Fork or Parallel::Jobs or something.
* N temp dirs. Only need to communicated back win/lose via exitval

worked-out example on a large codebase that isn't a single file
* ack is already combined up

make end-to-end tests easier to run as actual tests
* fake (ack)
* real (dependent on perl version, alas... perlbrew instructions?)
